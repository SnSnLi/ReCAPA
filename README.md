# ReCAPA (Reflective Contrastive and Prompt Alignment) Project

## ðŸ“– Project Introduction

ReCAPA (Reflective Contrastive and Prompt Alignment) is an intelligent agent system based on reflection and self-navigation, specifically designed to solve complex tasks in virtual home environments. This project combines Large Language Models (LLM) and reinforcement learning techniques to achieve intelligent task execution in vision-language agent environments.
